# Quarto Extensions

Repo for hosting all of my quarto extensions.

## Invoice

This extension is to create invoices whenever work as a contractor is completed. It is a simple file. If interested in increasing its use past what the extension currently is, please create a pull request.

## Resume Extension

This extension is a resume that is modeled after my current resume. The extension primarily relies on typst code in the `template.qmd` file. This decision was made to allow for more flexibility when creating a resume. The resume could also be completely changed while the only concrete changes are the margin sizes.

## Cover Letter Extension

This extension is a simple cover letter template that includes contact information in the footer of the page. If interested in increasing its use past what the extension currently is, please create a pull request.
